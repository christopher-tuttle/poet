# Poet

I was recently nerd-sniped:

_"There's no quick way to create a rhyming dictionary is there?"_

_"I'm frustrated having tapped out existing rhyming dictionaries' capacity (they
cluster on common words, limiting vocab) and they don't allow you to add new
words. I'm wondering if there'd be any more comprehensive search tool and
database if I understood UNIX or regular expressions or something. My next-best
alternative is to keep a word bank in a spreadsheet with columns separated by
final phoneme."_


Poet is a webapp that tries to verify some given text matches a set form
(e.g. that it is a "correct" sonnet, haiku, etc.).

It's also a means for me to learn some Rust.
